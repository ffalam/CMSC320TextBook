    "Data has become the foundation of decision-making in modern organizations. From social media platforms storing billions of user interactions to hospitals managing electronic health records, most of this information is stored in **databases**. Among different types of databases, **relational databases** are the most widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases organize data into tables, which consist of **rows (records)** and **columns (attributes)**. This design reflects the way data naturally relates to entities in the real world. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A retail store has customers (with IDs, names, and ages).\n",
    "* Each customer places orders (with product details, dates, and amounts).\n",
    "* The relationship between customers and orders can be represented through keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "To interact with these databases, we use a language called **Structured Query Language (SQL)**.\n",

    "### Structured Query Language (SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL provides a standardized way to create, read, update, and delete data (commonly referred to as CRUD operations). Unlike programming languages such as Python or Java, SQL is declarative: you specify what you want, and the database figures out how to get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it highly efficient for managing large datasets. For data science, SQL is invaluable for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Retrieval:** Extracting specific subsets of data from large databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**  Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and creating new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  Performing quick summaries, aggregations, and data profiling.\n",

    "# The Evolution of Databases and SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Early data management:** Before databases, organizations stored information in files. This approach led to redundancy, inconsistency, and inefficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Birth of the relational model:** In 1970, Edgar F. Codd introduced the relational model, a mathematical foundation for organizing data in tables with well-defined relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Development of SQL:** By the late 1970s, IBM developed SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), which evolved into SQL. It became the ANSI standard in 1986.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SQL today:** Almost every relational database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite) supports SQL, with minor dialect differences.\n",

    "# Relational Databases: Core Concepts\n",
    "Relational databases are the backbone of structured data storage. They organize information in a way that ensures consistency, integrity, and efficient retrieval. The fundamental ideas of tables, keys, and relationships help us understand how real-world data is modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tables, Rows, and Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "A table is like a spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rows (records/tuples):** Each row corresponds to a single entity or instance of data. For example, one row might represent a single customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Columns (fields/attributes):** Each column stores one specific type of information about the entity, such as name, age, or gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Schema:** The structure of the table, which defines what columns exist and their data types (e.g., integer, string, date).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "A Customers table may contain columns such as Customer_ID, Name, Age, Gender, and Email. Each row represents one customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys in Relational Databases are crucial for ensuring that data remains **unique** and **consistent** across tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Primary Key (PK)\n",
