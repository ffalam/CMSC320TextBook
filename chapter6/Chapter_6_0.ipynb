    "# Why Probability Matters in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is more than mathematics — it is a way of thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "It teaches us how to **reason under uncertainty**, how to **update beliefs when new data arrives**, and how to **separate signal from noise**. Every experiment you design, every model you train, and every prediction you report relies on these ideas, even when the formulas stay behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Probability does not promise certainty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It promises **clarity in uncertain situations**, and that is one of the most honest promises data science can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Gentle Walk Through Probability: Making Sense of Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are standing outside, checking the sky before leaving home. The forecast says there is a **30% chance of rain**. You hesitate. Should you take an umbrella?\n",
    "\n",
    "That small pause before a decision is where **probability theory** lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is not about predicting exactly what will happen. It is about describing what *might* happen, how likely it is, and how our beliefs should change when we learn something new. In data science, probability quietly sits underneath almost everything: experiments, models, predictions, and decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s build this story from the ground up."
