        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we introduced probability as a way to reason about **uncertainty** and showed how **probability distributions describe how data is generated** in real-world settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "We began with the **laws of probability**, which define how probabilities behave and ensure consistency:\n",
        "- probabilities are always non-negative\n",
        "- the total probability of all possible outcomes is 1\n",
        "- probabilities of mutually exclusive events add together\n",
        "\n",
        "We then introduced **expected value**, which represents the long-run average outcome of a random process and is a key concept for reasoning about outcomes in data science.\n",
        "\n",
        "We distinguished between **discrete** and **continuous** distributions and covered the most common ones used in data science:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Bernoulli**: models a single yes/no outcome (foundation of binary classification)\n",
        "- **Binomial**: models repeated Bernoulli trials (used in A/B testing and conversions)\n",
        "- **Poisson**: models event counts over time or space (arrivals, errors, failures)\n",
        "- **Zero-Inflated Poisson**: handles count data with many zeros (sparse user activity)\n",
        "- **Uniform**: assumes all values in a range are equally likely (simulations, baselines)\n",
        "- **Normal (Gaussian)**: models noise, error, and averages\n",
        "\n",
        "We also introduced the **Central Limit Theorem**, which explains why **averages often follow a Normal distribution**, even when the original data does not. This idea supports many statistical tools used in data science.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key takeaway is that **distribution awareness comes before modeling**.  \n",
        "The choice of distribution affects:\n",
        "- which assumptions are valid\n",
        "- which models are appropriate\n",
        "- which evaluation metrics make sense\n",
        "\n",
        "In data science, effective modeling begins with understanding **how data is generated**.  \n",
        "Probability distributions provide the language to describe that process clearly and correctly."
