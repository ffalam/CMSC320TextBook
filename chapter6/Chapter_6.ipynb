        "# Key Takeaways: SQL\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Relational Databases Structure**\n",
        "   - Data is organized into **tables**, consisting of **rows** (records) and **columns** (attributes).  \n",
        "   - **Primary Keys (PK)** uniquely identify rows, and **Foreign Keys (FK)** link tables to maintain **referential integrity**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Core SQL Commands**\n",
        "   - `CREATE TABLE` – define a new table.  \n",
        "   - `INSERT INTO` – add rows of data.  \n",
        "   - `SELECT` – retrieve data.  \n",
        "   - `WHERE` – filter rows.  \n",
        "   - `UPDATE` / `DELETE` – modify or remove data.  \n",
        "   - `DROP TABLE` – remove a table permanently.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **The “Big 6” Elements of a SELECT Statement**\n",
        "   - **SELECT:** Choose columns.  \n",
        "   - **FROM:** Specify tables.  \n",
        "   - **WHERE:** Filter rows.  \n",
        "   - **GROUP BY:** Aggregate rows.  \n",
        "   - **HAVING:** Filter aggregated results.  \n",
        "   - **ORDER BY:** Sort results.  \n",
        "   - **LIMIT:** Restrict the number of rows returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **JOINs for Combining Tables**\n",
        "   - **INNER JOIN:** Only matching rows.  \n",
        "   - **LEFT JOIN:** All left table rows, matched right table rows.  \n",
        "   - **RIGHT JOIN:** All right table rows, matched left table rows.  \n",
        "   - **FULL OUTER JOIN:** All rows from both tables, NULL for missing matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Aggregations and Filtering**\n",
        "   - Use `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` for aggregation.  \n",
        "   - Use `GROUP BY` to summarize data per category.  \n",
        "   - Use `HAVING` to filter **after aggregation** (cannot use WHERE for aggregated results).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **SQL in Python with Pandas**\n",
        "   - `sqlite3` allows creating a **lightweight database** in Colab.  \n",
        "   - Use `pd.read_sql_query()` to **load SQL query results directly into a DataFrame** for analysis.  \n",
        "   - Combining SQL + Pandas enables **powerful data workflows** in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Best Practices**\n",
        "   - Always use **WHERE** when updating or deleting rows.  \n",
        "   - Use **table aliases** for readability in JOINs.  \n",
        "   - Use **LIMIT** when exploring large datasets to preview data efficiently.  \n",
        "   - Test queries on **sample data** before running on full datasets.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**  \n",
        "By mastering table creation, data insertion, SELECT statements, JOINs, aggregation, and integration with Pandas, you can perform **complex data analysis** efficiently in SQL and Python. This chapter lays the foundation for building **real-world data pipelines and analytical workflows**.\n"
