    "\n",
    "A company launches an online ad with the following outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With probability 0.2, the user clicks and the company earns **+$5**\n",
    "\n",
    "- With probability 0.8, the user does not click and the company loses **\u2212$1** (ad cost)\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible outcomes:\n",

    "- $X = 5$ with probability 0.2  \n",
    "- $X = -1$ with probability 0.8  \n",

    "Expected value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{E}[X] = (5)(0.2) + (-1)(0.8)$  \n",
    "$\\mathbb{E}[X] = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer (a):** The expected profit per ad is **$0.20**.\n",

    "**Answer (b):**  \n",
    "Even though most users do not click, the campaign is profitable *on average* over many impressions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each user independently clicks an ad with probability $p = 0.05$.  \n",
    "The ad is shown to **200 users**.\n",

    "**(a)** What distribution models the number of clicks?  \n",
    "**(b)** What is the expected number of clicks?\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Each user click is a Bernoulli trial. The total number of clicks is the sum of many Bernoulli trials.\n",
