    "\n",
    "1. **Mutually exclusive:** No two $B_i$ events happen at the same time.  \n",
    "2. **Exhaustive:** One of the $B_i$ events must happen.  \n",
    "3. **Conditional probability:** $P(A \\mid B_i)$ is the probability of $A$ given $B_i$ occurs.  \n",
    "4. The law sums over all possible scenarios to get the total probability of $A$.\n",
    "> **Mutually exclusive and exhaustive event:** Events that cannot happen at the same time (*mutually exclusive*) and cover all possible outcomes (*exhaustive*).\n",

    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there are two factories producing light bulbs:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Factory 1 produces 60% of all bulbs, with a 1% defect rate.  \n",
    "- Factory 2 produces 40% of all bulbs, with a 2% defect rate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What is the probability that a randomly chosen bulb is defective?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution using the Law of Total Probability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{Defective}) = P(\\text{Defective} \\mid F_1) P(F_1) + P(\\text{Defective} \\mid F_2) P(F_2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{Defective}) = 0.01 \\times 0.6 + 0.02 \\times 0.4 = 0.014\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there is a **1.4% chance** that a randomly chosen bulb is defective.\n",
