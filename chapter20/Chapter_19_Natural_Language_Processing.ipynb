        "# Introduction: What is Natural Language Processing?\n",
        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computational Linguistics focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way. As the primary mode of human communication, natural language is rich, nuanced, and often ambiguous. NLP bridges the gap between human language and machine-understandable formats, enabling a wide range of applications, from automated translation systems to intelligent chatbots and sentiment analysis engines.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "> NLP teaches machines how to read, listen, understand, and talk like humans, or at least as close as we can get.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "With the rapid growth of digital data—emails, social media posts, news articles, product reviews, and more—NLP has become a cornerstone technology in data-driven decision-making. NLP combines techniques from computer science, linguistics, and machine learning to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Advances in machine learning and deep learning have pushed NLP from rule-based systems to state-of-the-art models capable of reasoning with context, tone, and semantics. Applications of NLP include:\n",

        "* Machine Translation (e.g., Google Translate)\n",
        "* Sentiment Analysis (e.g., analyzing product reviews)\n",
        "* Chatbots & Virtual Assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)\n",
        "* Text Summarization (e.g., news article summarization)\n",

        "\n",
        "NLP began in the 1950s with a focus on symbolic approaches. Early researchers developed rule-based systems where grammar rules were manually coded. For example, machine translation systems like the Georgetown-IBM experiment (1954) translated a few Russian sentences into English using a small set of linguistic rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "- High maintenance effort\n",
        "- Poor adaptability to new domains\n",
        "- Limited understanding of context\n",

        "### **19.2.2 Statistical NLP (1990s–2010s)**\n",
        "With the availability of large datasets and increased computational power, NLP shifted toward statistical models. Probabilistic approaches, such as n-gram language models, Bayesian classifiers, and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), became popular. These methods learned patterns from text data instead of relying solely on hand-written rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key advantages:\n",

        "\n",
        "The advent of deep learning revolutionized NLP. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks improved the modeling of sequential data. Later, transformer architectures—introduced in “**Attention Is All You Need**” (2017)—enabled massive improvements in tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering. Pre-trained language models such as BERT, GPT, and T5 have since set new benchmarks across nearly all NLP tasks.\n",
