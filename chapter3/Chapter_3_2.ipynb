    "# Bias in Experiments: **Placebo & Blinding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with randomization and careful design, participants can change their behavior simply because they know they are being studied. This can introduce bias into an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Placebo Effect**\n",
    "The placebo effect happens when people show improvement even though they received a **“fake”** or placebo treatment with no active ingredient. The improvement comes from expectations, not the treatment itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: In medical trials, patients receiving a sugar pill may still report less pain because they believe they are receiving medication.\n",

    "\n",
    "The placebo effect is a form of **expectation bias**. To minimize it, experiments use **placebo controls** so that both groups have similar expectations. This helps separate the **true treatment effect** from **psychological or expectation effects**.\n",

    "#### **How to Minimize Bias? Blinding (Single-Blind / Double-Blind)**\n",
    "Blinding means that participants, researchers, or both do not know who received the treatment. This prevents behavior or measurement from being influenced by expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-blind:** participants do not know which group they are in.\n",
    "- **Double-blind:** neither participants nor researchers know, until the experiment ends.\n",

    "\n",
    "Experiments are powerful but imperfect. Key constraints include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ethical considerations:** especially in health or policy settings\n",
    "* **Cost:** running experiments may require incentives or infrastructure\n",
    "* **Interference:** treatments can spill over between users\n",
    "* **Limited sample sizes**\n",
    "* **Time to measure outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some scenarios (e.g., earthquakes, economic crises, pandemics), controlled experiments are impossible; forcing analysts to rely on natural experiments or causal inference techniques."
