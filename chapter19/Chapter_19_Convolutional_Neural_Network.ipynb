These small matrix of weights slides over the input data (such as an image), performs element-wise multiplication with the part of the input it is currently on, and then sums up all the results into a single output pixel. This process is known as convolution. Kernels are the key elements that allow CNNs to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features within the input data. In image processing, a kernel might be a small matrix like 3x3 or 5x5.\n",

This is made possible by pooling layers, which summarize small regions of the activation maps—using operations like max or average—rather than keeping exact pixel locations. This allows the network to focus more on what feature is present, rather than where exactly it is.

Instead of training a CNN from scratch (which requires a lot of data and computing resources), transfer learning leverages the knowledge the network has already learned—such as detecting edges, textures, and shapes.\n",
