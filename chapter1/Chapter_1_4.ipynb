    "# Summary of the Chapter\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science begins with a simple idea: the world produces traces, and those traces contain patterns. This chapter showed how the field grew out of older traditions—statistics, computing, and scientific experimentation, and how the explosion of digital data pushed those traditions into new territory. The goal is not just to collect information, but to ask questions that matter and to use data to answer them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduced the notion of a **data science lifecycle**: defining a question, gathering data, cleaning and organizing it, analyzing patterns, building models when useful, and finally communicating what was learned. The lifecycle gives data science its shape. It is iterative rather than linear, driven as much by curiosity as by technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we positioned data science within its broader ecosystem. Machine learning lends predictive tools; AI pushes toward perception and decision-making; databases and engineering keep the pipelines flowing; visualization turns results into stories people can act on. Big data added new challenges of scale and speed, and with it came new tools: Python, SQL, notebooks, and cloud systems, that make the work possible in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter was meant to set the stage. The chapters ahead will look closer at the materials of data science: what data looks like, how it is structured, how we measure and clean it, how we explore it, and how we eventually build models. Before we learn how to reason from data, we must become familiar with the data itself."
