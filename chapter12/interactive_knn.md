# Interactive K-Nearest Neighbors

This tool lets you explore how the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm works by finding the k closest points to a target node.

âœ… How to Use:

- Adjust the k slider to change the number of nearest neighbors (1-15).
- Observe how changing k affects which points are considered "neighbors"
- View statistics including individual distances and the average distance to all k neighbors
