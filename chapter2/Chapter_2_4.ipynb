    "Data does not come in a single form. It may appear as numbers in a table, sounds from a microphone, pixels in an image, words in a review, or connections in a network. Each shape of data brings its own assumptions and tools, and more importantly, its own way of seeing the world. A spreadsheet invites comparison; a time-series reveals change; a graph exposes relationships; and an image asks to be interpreted.\n",

    "The first step in data science is simply recognizing **what kind of information we have** and **how it is organized**. We do not analyze a voice recording the way we analyze an invoice, nor do we treat a timestamp like a photograph. Structure matters. It determines what questions we can ask and what answers we can trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding data shapes is also practical. It tells us which formats are useful, which tools to reach for, and how much cleaning or transformation will be required. We do not clean data just to make it pretty, we shape it so that it can answer a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next chapter takes us from **recognizing data** to **reasoning with data**. It will focus on asking better questions and on the principles of **experimental design**, where curiosity meets structure and evidence begins to speak.\n",
