    "# The Invisible Enemy: **Confounders**\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments would be simple if the world contained only **two variables**: one we change and one we measure. In reality, almost every outcome is influenced by many factors we do not control.\n",
    "\n",
    "These extra influences are called **confounders**, hidden variables that affect the outcome but are not part of the intended treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is a Confounder?**  \n",
    "> A confounder is an outside factor that makes it harder to tell whether the treatment actually caused the change we observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A confounder typically:\n",
    "> * affects the independent variable (treatment), and\n",
    "> * affects the dependent variable (outcome), and\n",
    "> * creates the appearance that X causes Y when something else is influencing both\n",
    "\n",
    "> In short, confounders can create a misleading or “fake” relationship between the variables we care about.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparing two school tutoring programs **without considering family income** may lead to misleading conclusions.\n",
    "- Online, testing a new website layout **without considering device type (mobile vs desktop)** may distort click-through rates (CTR).\n",

    "### **Strategies for Controlling Confounders**\n",
    "\n",
    "Good experimental design addresses confounding **before** data is collected, and good analysis techniques help address it **after** data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, strategies fall into two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Design Stage (Before Data Collection)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the planning stage; the experiment hasn’t been run yet.\n",
    "Decisions made here affect how data is collected. The best time to handle confounders is early, during this planning of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Randomization**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Randomization just means we randomly put people (or units) into different groups. **Why random?** Because if we don’t, the groups might be unfair from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly assigning participants to treatment groups helps ensure that confounders (both known and unknown) are evenly distributed across groups.This reduces systematic differences and strengthens causal interpretation.\n",
    "> Now if the two groups behave differently, we can be more confident the treatment caused it, not some hidden factor in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply randomization in different ways. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a) Random Sampling:**  \n",
    "We put individuals into groups **purely at random**, without considering characteristics like age, device type, or prior behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** Randomly assigning students to two study methods helps balance motivation, prior knowledge, and study habits across groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea:**  **Random Sampling** balances confounders **on average**.\n",
    "\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes randomization alone is not enough, especially when important subgroups behave differently. In those cases, we can use **stratified randomization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b) Stratified Randomization:**  \n",
    "We first **group (stratify)** people based on an important characteristic, then randomly assign within each group. We stratify when certain characteristics matter, such as: age, gender, device type, customer type (new vs returning), performance level, income bracket, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** Before randomizing, users are split into “mobile” and “desktop” strata. Within each stratum, users are randomly assigned to version A or B. This ensures the comparison isn’t distorted if mobile users behave differently than desktop users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea:**  **Stratified Randomization** balances confounders **within subgroups**, not just on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",

    "  <em>Figure 5B. Full population being split into strata first, then randomized within each subgroup. Source: Benchmark Six Sigma forum.</em>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, randomization helps make the groups similar on average so that differences in outcomes are more likely due to the treatment and not some hidden factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Restriction**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Restriction means we **limit** who or what we include in the experiment so the groups are more similar to begin with.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Restriction reduces confounding by limiting the experiment to a more comparable subgroup, so it cannot vary. Remember, you **only study one subgroup**, everyone outside that subgroup is excluded. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If we’re testing a new rehab treatment, we might only include patients aged 40–60 instead of everyone from 10 to 90. This avoids age becoming a distracting factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZiZsg5BjJTltyYIyneWZtPqNb0003Cx8\" width=\"350\">\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <em>Figure 6. With restriction, we only include adults ages 40–60 in the experiment. <br>Age cannot vary anymore</br>.</em>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Restriction reduces confounders by removing variation in that characteristic. By restricting who is included, we reduce variation and make it easier to compare outcomes fairly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Matching / Blocking**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Matching:** reduces confounding by pairing or grouping units that share important characteristics before assigning treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We keep participants with different characteristics, but we **pair or group them** so that the treatment and control groups are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Units can be matched on age, income, or baseline performance.\n",
    "- One member of each pair receives the **treatment**, and the other receives the **control**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes comparisons more fair because each treated unit has a similar “partner” in the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Idea:** Unlike restriction, matching does not remove variation; it balances it across groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Pairing 45-year-old participants with other 45-year-olds before random assignment.\n",
    "- If two students have similar grades and similar study habits, we can match them, one gets Method A, the other gets Method B. Now the comparison is cleaner, because we controlled for those similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blocking:** When matching is done in **groups rather than pairs**, the approach is often called **blocking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Idea**: Group subjects into blocks based on a potential confounder. Then randomize within each block\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** we might block by age group (e.g., 18–25, 26–35, 36–45) and then randomize treatment vs control within each block so age doesn’t skew the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a) Block Design (Matched Pair):**\n",
    "\n",
    "A matched-pair design is a special case of a randomized block design where each block contains two similar participants. The key idea is to **compare like with like**.\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "Matching (or blocking) means we pair up similar units before giving out the treatments. The idea is: **compare like with like**. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "- Participants are first **paired based on** a confounding characteristic such as **prior knowledge**, and then randomly assigned to treatment or control within each pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One member of the pair serves as the **control** (normal study time) and the other as the **treatment** (increased study time).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both students start with similar baseline ability, differences in exam scores are more likely due to study time rather than pre-existing differences.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Analysis Stage (After Data Collection)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If confounders were not fully handled during design, they can still be addressed at the analysis stage using statistical techniques. This stage happens after the experiment (or observational study) has produced data.\n",

    "- A company could rerun an A/B test in week 2 after seeing results in week 1.\n",
    "- A researcher could reanalyze the data using different subsets or models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication checks whether a result is reliable or just a fluke. It does not remove confounders by itself, but it reveals whether a finding holds up under repeated testing.\n",

    "\n",
