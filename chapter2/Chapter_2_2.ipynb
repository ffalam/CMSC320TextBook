    "\n",
    "Experiments are powerful but imperfect. Key constraints include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ethical considerations:** especially in health or policy settings\n",
    "* **Cost:** running experiments may require incentives or infrastructure\n",
    "* **Interference:** treatments can spill over between users\n",
    "* **Limited sample sizes**\n",
    "* **Time to measure outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some scenarios (e.g., earthquakes, economic crises, pandemics), controlled experiments are impossible; forcing analysts to rely on natural experiments or causal inference techniques."

    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we learned how data science uses **experiments** and **observational studies** to answer questions. Experiments can show **cause and effect** because we change something and compare results. Observational studies help us learn about the world without changing anything, but they cannot easily show what causes what.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw that good **experimental design** must deal with **confounders** and **bias** so that comparisons are fair. When experiments are hard to run, **surveys** and **simulations** give us other ways to collect information and test ideas. Understanding how studies are designed helps us avoid confusing **correlation** with **causation**.\n",
