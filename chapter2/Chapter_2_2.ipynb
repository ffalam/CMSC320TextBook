    "# **Data Formats in Data Science**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we understand how data is described and how it is organized, the next layer to consider is how data is **formatted** for storage, transport, and consumption by tools. Formats determine how information is encoded on disk, how it moves between systems, and how efficiently it can be parsed or processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different formats are optimized for different tasks: tabular data favors simple delimiters, hierarchical data favors nested keys, documents favor markup, and rich media requires specialized encoding. Understanding formats is essential for working with modern data pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "These structural categories map naturally to different file formats used in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured** → CSV, SQL tables  \n",
    "- **Semi-structured** → JSON, XML, HTML, logs  \n",
    "- **Unstructured** → JPEG, MP3, MP4, PDF, TIFF\n",

    "\n",
    "CSV (Comma-Separated Values) and TSV (Tab-Separated Values) are among the simplest and most widely used data formats. They store **tabular**, structured data in plain text, where each row represents a record and each column corresponds to a field.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **delimiter** is the character that separates values in a row. Common delimiters include commas (`,`), tabs (`\\t`), semicolons (`;`), and colons (`:`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**CSV** uses commas as the delimiter; commonly used for tabular data. It is popular because it is lightweight, human-readable, and compatible with nearly every data analysis tool, from Excel to Python's *pandas*. Example CSV snippet:\n",

    "## **(II) JSON**\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) represents **semi-structured**, hierarchical data. It supports nesting, arrays, and variable-length fields, making it flexible for web APIs, mobile applications, and configuration data.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON structures are built from **key–value pairs**, where each key identifies a field and each value holds the associated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **JSON Syntax Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the smallest level, JSON data is expressed as a **key–value pair**: JSON follows a small set of structural rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data is presented in key/value pairs.\n",
    "- Data elements are separated by commas.\n",
    "- Curly brackets {} determine objects.\n",
    "  - **Objects** are enclosed in `{ }` and contain key–value pairs  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VHjrV.gif\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square brackets [] designate arrays.\n",
    "  - **Arrays** are enclosed in `[ ]` and hold ordered lists  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "  <img src=\"  https://i.sstatic.net/OCsS0.gif\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keys** are strings: sequences of characters surrounded by quotation marks.\n",
    "- **Values** may be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, or `null`\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "  <img src=\"  https://i.sstatic.net/7zOHB.gif\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**, A colon is placed between each key and value, with a comma separating pairs. Both components are held in quotation marks.\n",
    "As a result, JSON object literal syntax looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> {\"key\":\"value\",\"key\":\"value\",\"key\":\"value\".}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example JSON snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 24, \"languages\": [\"Python\", \"SQL\"]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON also supports nesting through objects and arrays. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "  \"age\": 24,\n",

    "## **(III) HTML and XML**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are markup languages that describe structure using tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** describes the structure and display of web pages. It defines elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and tables. HTML focuses on **presentation** and is interpreted by web browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example HTML snippet:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p>Hello, world!</p>\n",
    "<a href=\"https://umd.edu\">Visit UMD</a>\n",
    "```\n",
    "HTML is not intended to store arbitrary data for computation. Instead, it tells browsers how content should appear and how users interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**XML (eXtensible Markup Language)** uses tags to describe **data and relationships** rather than presentation. Unlike HTML, XML does not have predefined tags. Users may *define their own custom tags*, which makes XML flexible for representing custom structures and domain-specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "XML is **self-describing**, **hierarchical**, and can represent nested structures similar to JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "> XML is often used for data storage or exchange, especially in enterprise systems, configuration files, and legacy APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example XML snippet:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<person>\n",
    "  <name>Alice</name>\n",
    "  <age>24</age>\n",
    "  <languages>\n",
    "    <language>Python</language>\n",
    "    <language>SQL</language>\n",
    "  </languages>\n",
    "</person>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "XML values are contained inside tags, and fields can repeat or nest, which gives XML flexibility for representing structured documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "> HTML is primarily for presentation, while XML is more general-purpose and can encode hierarchical data for communication between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Where They Appear**\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTML → browsers, webpages, crawlers, scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "* XML → configuration files, enterprise systems, legacy APIs, document formats (e.g., DOCX uses XML internally)\n",
    "\n",
    "* JSON → REST APIs, mobile apps, NoSQL databases, log formats\n",
    "\n",
    "All three formats belong to the broader landscape of semi-structured data, sitting between rigid tables and free-form text.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **(IV) Relational Databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases store data in a structured form using **tables** (rows and columns) and a well-defined **schema**. Each table represents an entity (e.g., `students`, `courses`, `orders`), and each row represents a record. Tables can be linked through **keys**, allowing meaningful relationships to be expressed and queried efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational formats enforce consistency through datatypes, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. They excel in transactional systems (e.g., banking, e-commerce, logistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why \"Relational\"?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **relational** comes from mathematics: each table is a **relation**, each row is a **tuple**, and each column is an **attribute**. Tables become powerful when they are **related** to one another through shared keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "These relationships allow us to combine information across tables (e.g., *students ↔ courses ↔ enrollments*) without duplicating data across the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- --- -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Keys:** Linking Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases rely on two important types of keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **primary key** uniquely identifies a row within a table (e.g., `student_id`).\n",
    "- A **foreign key** references a primary key in another table, creating a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (conceptual):\n",
    "- `students(id)` is the primary key for students.\n",
    "- `enrollments(student_id)` is a foreign key pointing back to `students(id)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys enforce consistency and prevent invalid references (e.g., enrolling a student that does not exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is a Database Schema?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **schema** is the blueprint of the database. It defines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- what tables exist\n",
    "- what columns each table contains\n",
    "- the datatype of each column\n",
    "- how tables relate to one another (via keys)\n",
    "- rules or constraints that ensure valid data\n",
    "\n",
    "Example schema (informal):\n",
    "```\n",
    "students(\n",
    "id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "name TEXT,\n",
    "major TEXT,\n",

    "---\n",
    "## **BONUS Part: NoSQL Databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases shine when data is highly structured and relationships are well-defined. But not all data fits neatly into tables. Modern applications produce logs, events, nested objects, user interactions, sensor streams, and media, data that grows fast and changes shape over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL** databases *relax the rigid schema* of relational systems to support higher scalability and more flexible data models. Instead of enforcing a single blueprint (schema), NoSQL systems allow the structure of records to evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different NoSQL databases optimize for different shapes of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document stores** (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase)  \n",
    "  Store JSON-like objects with nested fields. Great for user profiles, product catalogs, or application events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key–value stores** (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)  \n",
    "  Store simple (key → value) mappings. Ideal for caching, session storage, configuration, and real-time lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wide column stores** (e.g., Bigtable, Cassandra)  \n",
    "  Organize data by column families. Used in time-series analytics, telemetry, and large distributed workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph databases** (e.g., Neo4j)  \n",
    "  Represent nodes and edges directly. Useful for social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and biological pathways.\n",

    "### **How Image Data Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Images are typically organized as a grid of **pixels**, the tiny building blocks that form the picture. Each pixel holds **color information** through separate **channels**. In a standard color image:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the channels are **red, green, and blue (RGB)**  \n",
    "- each channel acts like a separate layer of information  \n",
    "- each channel value ranges from **0 to 255**, representing intensity  \n",
    "  - `0` means no intensity (dark)\n",
    "  - `255` means full intensity (bright)\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining intensities across channels produces the full range of visible colors. Machine learning models (e.g., vision transformers, CNNs) operate directly on these pixel arrays and often convert them into structured **embeddings** for downstream tasks such as classification or detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audio and video follow the same idea at higher dimensionalities: audio stores **waveforms** over time; video stores sequences of **image frames**, sometimes with sound and metadata attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models for speech, vision, and multimodal data help translate these rich formats into structured forms that can be queried, compared, or used for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Choosing the Right Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single “best” format. CSV is ideal for spreadsheets; JSON is ideal for APIs; SQL is ideal for transactions; NoSQL is ideal for flexible schemas; media formats are essential for perception tasks. Data scientists must often convert between formats depending on the application.\n",
