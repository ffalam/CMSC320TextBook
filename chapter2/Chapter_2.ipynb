SQL supports powerful operations for filtering, joining, aggregating, and updating structured data.\n","\n","\n","Relational systems enforce consistency through:\n","\n","- **data types** (integer, string, date, boolean, etc.)  \n","- **primary keys** (unique identifiers for rows)  \n","- **foreign keys** (references linking tables)  \n","- **constraints** (rules that maintain data integrity)  \n","\n","These properties make relational databases ideal for transactional systems such as banking, logistics, retail, reservations, and scientific measurement.\n","**Example Table: Students**\n","\n","| id | name  | major              | year |\n","|----|-------|-------------------|------|\n","| 1  | Alice | Computer Science  | 2025 |\n","| 2  | Bob   | Mathematics       | 2024 |\n","\n","**Example SQL Query**\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT name, major\n","FROM students\n","WHERE year = 2025;\n","```\n","*(We will talk about SQL in later chapter)*\n","\n","Relational databases excel when data must be consistent, structured, and queryable, especially when multiple tables relate to each other (e.g., students ↔ courses ↔ enrollments).\n","\n","They are widely used in banking systems, logistics, healthcare, retail, reservations, and scientific measurement—any domain where correctness and structure matter.\n","\n","---\n","## **BONUS Part: NoSQL Databases**\n","\n","Relational databases shine when data is highly structured and relationships are well-defined. But not all data fits neatly into tables. Modern applications produce logs, events, nested objects, user interactions, sensor streams, and media, data that grows fast and changes shape over time.\n","\n","**NoSQL** databases *relax the rigid schema* of relational systems to support higher scalability and more flexible data models. Instead of enforcing a single blueprint (schema), NoSQL systems allow the structure of records to evolve.\n","\n","Different NoSQL databases optimize for different shapes of data:\n","\n","- **Document stores** (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase)  \n","  Store JSON-like objects with nested fields. Great for user profiles, product catalogs, or application events.\n","\n","- **Key–value stores** (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)  \n","  Store simple (key → value) mappings. Ideal for caching, session storage, configuration, and real-time lookups.\n","\n","- **Wide column stores** (e.g., Bigtable, Cassandra)  \n","  Organize data by column families. Used in time-series analytics, telemetry, and large distributed workloads.\n","\n","- **Graph databases** (e.g., Neo4j)  \n","  Represent nodes and edges directly. Useful for social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and biological pathways.\n","\n","\n","<center>\n","  <img src=\"https://www.scylladb.com/wp-content/uploads/differences-between-sql-databases-and-nosql-databases.png\" width=\"430\">\n","  <br>\n","  <em><strong>Figure 12.</strong> High-level comparison of relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases, highlighting differences in schema, consistency, and scalability.

Common scenarios include:\n","\n","- millions of user profiles with different fields  \n","- real-time click streams and telemetry data  \n","- nested JSON returned from APIs  \n","- social networks with rich relationships  \n","- sensor and IoT data  \n","- rapidly evolving application data  \n","\n","In short, **NoSQL trades strict relational structure for flexibility and scale**.

Rich media formats dominate modern applications, especially in machine learning, robotics, healthcare, and online platforms.\n","\n","Examples include:\n","\n","- **Images**: JPEG, PNG, TIFF  \n","- **Audio**: WAV, MP3, FLAC  \n","- **Video**: MP4, AVI, MOV  \n","\n","These formats encode pixels, waveforms, or frames in compressed or uncompressed forms.\n","\n","### **How Image Data Works**\n","\n","Images are typically organized as a grid of **pixels**, the tiny building blocks that form the picture. Each pixel holds **color information** through separate **channels**. In a standard color image:\n","\n","- the channels are **red, green, and blue (RGB)**  \n","- each channel acts like a separate layer of information  \n","- each channel value ranges from **0 to 255**, representing intensity  \n","  - `0` means no intensity (dark)\n","  - `255` means full intensity (bright)\n","<center>\n","  <img src=\"https://process.filestackapi.com/cache=expiry:max/pAVCjc9LSYSFYnkM4HtK\" width=\"600\">\n","  <br>\n","  <em><strong>Figure 13.</strong> Visualization related to image data structures or pixel representation.

Machine learning models (e.g., vision transformers, CNNs) operate directly on these pixel arrays and often convert them into structured **embeddings** for downstream tasks such as classification or detection.\n","\n","Audio and video follow the same idea at higher dimensionalities: audio stores **waveforms** over time; video stores sequences of **image frames**, sometimes with sound and metadata attached.\n","\n","Machine learning models for speech, vision, and multimodal data help translate these rich formats into structured forms that can be queried, compared, or used for prediction.\n","\n","\n","## **Choosing the Right Format**\n","\n","There is no single “best” format. CSV is ideal for spreadsheets; JSON is ideal for APIs; SQL is ideal for transactions; NoSQL is ideal for flexible schemas; media formats are essential for perception tasks. Data scientists must often convert between formats depending on the application.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"1Oa1krnYuiBx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Where Does Data Come From?\n","\n","Historically, datasets arrived through organized channels: government surveys, institutional studies, corporate databases.
